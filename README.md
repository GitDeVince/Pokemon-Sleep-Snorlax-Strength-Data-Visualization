Dataset is based here: https://www.serebii.net/pokemonsleep/snorlaxratings.shtml

Pokemon Sleep is a new-ish mobile game from the Pokemon Series, where it tracks the person's sleep and turns it into rewards (aka pokemon encounter). 
One way to get more pokemon encounter is to rank up snorlax's strength. Higher it is, the higher the strength requirement it needs.
The least snorlax strength needed per rank to most: Greengrass Isle > Cyan Beach > Taupe Hollow > Snowdrop Tundra

Greengrass Isle is the first stage so it is obvious that it will require less snorlax strength to rank up. 

I separated Basic 1 to Ultra 5 and Master 1 to Master 20 due to how large the range of the Master Rank. 

I will update more to make it user friendly as possible with matplotlib (still learning) and will put some findings if I found some.
